## Last weeks objectives

(1) Learn the differences between types of mark-recapture models

(2) Learn to analyze mark-recapture data

<br>

## This weeks objectives

(1) Learn the the use and applications of occupancy and N-mixture models

(2) Learn to extrend these models to multi-season frameworks

<br>

## Goals

To correct for imperfect species/individual detection probability **without** uniquely marking individuals (like we learned last week)

## How do you do this?

We correct for imperct species/individaul detection by repeatedly sampling the *site* unit. 

Repeatedly sampling the site- known as repeated surveys:
    
  - Can be repeated *temporal* surveys
  
  - Assuming two sites nearby have the same probability of occupancy and detection (*spatial*)

## Why should we seperate the ecological and observations parts of the data?

- The extent of the species distribution will be underestimated when the detection probability is < 1

  - If a species is not found at all sites where it occures, then the perceived range will be smaller than the actual range.

- Estimates of covariate relationships will be biased towards zero when detection probability is < 1

  - Shown via simulations

- Factors that affect the difficulty with which a species is found may end up in a predictive models of species occurrence or may mask factors that do affect species occurence

  - Confounding the ecological and observational process (i.e., habitat A = more open, habitat B = more wooded)

## Important definitions

Occupancy probability: The probability that a site is occupied (i.e., that the abundance is greater than zero)

  - The realization of this probabilty gives rise to the proportion of sites occupied (i.e., filled) 
  
Detection probability: The probability that you will encounter an individual, *given* that it is present

## Example

We want to know the distribution of this ant:

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/7_Occupancy/Ant.png") 
``` 

in the Southeast United States:

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/Cici/EEMB595TE/7_Occupancy/map_region-southeast.png") 
``` 

## Data collection design

We sample 1000 sites for the ants and collect: detection/non-detection data

?? Why didn't I call this presence/absence data??

At each site, we go looking for ants at the *same site* for two consecutive days. 

## Simple occupancy model

$y_{i,j}$ = observed data = detection/non-detection of the species at site *i* during survey *j*

  - $y_{i,j}$ = 0 (species not detected at site *i* during survey *j*)
  
  - $y_{i,j}$ = 1 (species detected at site *i* during survey *j*)
  
$z_{i}$ = latent state variable =  presence/absence of the species at site *i* 

  - $z_{i}$ = 0 (species absent at site *i*)
  
  - $z_{i}$ = 1 (species present at site *i*)

The model:

(1) Ecological process

    $z_{i}$ $\sim$ Bernoulli($\psi$)

    - $\psi$ = occupancy probability
    
    - To make $\psi_{i}$ a function of a covariate, we use:
    
        logit($\psi_{i}$) = $\alpha$ + $\beta$ $X_{i}$
        
        - ?? Why is $\psi$ indexed by *i* here??
        
    - Notice you can only add site level covariates to *z*

(2) Observation process

    $y_{i,j}$ $\sim$ Bernoulli($z_{i}$ *p*)
    
    - Note that *p* is conditional on $z_{i}$ by multiplying p and z

    - ?? How would you make *p* a function of a covariate? And what would you need to change from the expression above? 

    - Notice you can add site or survey level covariates to *y*

<br>

## Model assumptions

Site-occupancy model assumptions (MacKenzie et al. 2002):

(1) The occupancy status of a site does not change over the course of sampling (i.e., closed population)

(2) The probability of occupancy is the same for all sites or any heterogeneity is related to covariates

(3) The probability of detection is the same across all sites and observations or any heterogeneity is related to covariates

(4) Detection histories at each location are independent

## Model written in JAGS code

```{r}

for(i in 1:nSites){

  z[i] ~ dbern(psi)

  for(j in 1:nSurveys){

    y[i,j] ~ dbern(p.eff[i,j])

    p.eff[i,j] <-  z[i] * p

  } # j

} # i

}
",fill = TRUE)

                   nSurveys = ncol(dat))

zinit <- apply(dat, 1, max)

inits <- function(){list(psi = runif(1, 0, 1),
                         p = runif(1, 0, 1),

        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 17, color = "black"), 
        axis.title.x =element_text(size = 17, color = "black"),
        legend.title =element_text(size = 17, color = "black"),
        legend.text =element_text(size = 17, color = "black"),

        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) 
```

We can add covariates.

We can add spatial autocorrelation (see Yackulic et al. 2012).

We can add multiple states (see Bailey et al. 2014).

We can add multiple seasons.

  - The principles we learned about last week about transition matrices can come into play here.

## N-mixture model

N-mixture model is used in the case where we have abundance of animals at sites that are repeatedly surveys (similar to occupancy model; Royle, 2004).

Also known as the Royle model and other names.

The model:

$x_{i,j}$ = observed data = abundance of the species at site *i* during survey *j*

$N_{i}$ = latent state variable = true abundance of the species at site *i* 

The model:

(1) Ecological process

    $N_{i}$ $\sim$ Poisson($\lambda$)

    - $\lambda$ = average number of animals across the site
        
    - Notice you can only add site level covariates to *z*

(2) Observation process

    $x_{i,j}$ $\sim$ Binomial($N_{i}$, *p*)

    - ?? Why are we using a Binomial distribution here instead of a Bernoulli?? 

## Model Assumptions

N-mixture model assumptions (Royle, 2004):

(1) The ecological state (e.g., abundance) is constant during the period over which replicate surveys are conducted (closure assumption)

(2) Detection probability is constant for all individuals present during the survey

(3) The distributions of abundance and detection are adequately described by the chosen parametric forms (e.g., Poisson, binomial)

(4) There are no false positives; such as double counts

## Multi-season occupancy model

This is the multi-season extension of the occupancy model.

Assume periods of open population dynamics between periods of closed population dynamics (when you do the surveys).

There is code in the folder to run this model.

You estimate:

  - True occupancy per season
  
  - Extinction rate for habitats
  
  - Colonization rates for habitats
  
  - Species detection probability

<br>

## Generalized N-mixture model

This is the multi-season extension of the N-mixture model.

Assume periods of open population dynamics between periods of closed population dynamics (when you do the surveys).

There is code in the folder to run this model.

You estimate:

  - True average abundance
  
  - Apparent survival probability (survival + emigration)
  
  - Recruitment rate (immigration + births)
  
  - Individual detection probability
