# Model assumptionf

#Dynamics site-occupancy model assumptions (Royle & KÃ©ry #2007)
#(1) The occupancy status of a site does not change over #the course of sampling (i.e., closed population)
#(2) The occupancy status of a site may change between #seasons, i.e., populations are "open" to extinction and #colonization 
#(3) The probability of occupancy, extinction, and #colonization is the same for all sites or any heterogeneit#y is related to covariates
#(4) The probability of detection is the same across all #sites and observations or any heterogeneity is related to #covariates
#(5) Detection histories at each location are independent
